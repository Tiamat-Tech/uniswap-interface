/**
 * Run with `bun test config/oxlint-plugins/mycelium-platform-legs.test.ts`
 *
 * Alignment guard for the platform-leg manifest
 * (packages/mycelium/platform-legs.json) that drives
 * `universe-custom/no-throwing-stub-imports`. Lives here rather than in
 * mycelium's vitest suite so it runs in the unconditional
 * `bun test config/oxlint-plugins` CI step — a mycelium exports change
 * must not be able to skip it via nx selection.
 *
 * What it pins:
 *  - every JS entry point in mycelium's package.json `exports` has a manifest
 *    row, and every manifest row is a real entry point — a new entry point
 *    cannot ship without declaring its platform legs, which is what keeps the
 *    lint gate from going silently blind to new throwing stubs;
 *  - statuses are from the closed enum the rule understands;
 *  - every leg declared 'throws' actually has platform-split files for that
 *    platform under the entry's directory (a stub can't be declared where no
 *    platform split exists).
 *
 * Known gap (review-bot follow-up, deferred): this only pins per-subpath
 * `exports` entries against their manifest rows, not the root ('.') entry's
 * own named-export *list* against `entryPoints['.'].namedExports` — nothing
 * here would catch a future `export { SomeStubLeggedThing } from '...'`
 * added to src/index.ts without a matching namedExports row, the same
 * failure mode this file already guards against one axis over. Not built
 * here: src/index.ts re-exports via `export *` from `@universe/tailwind/types`
 * among named exports, so pinning "the root barrel's actual named exports"
 * needs a real export-binding resolver (walk re-exports, including
 * wildcards, to their ultimate names), not a text scan — a bigger, more
 * failure-prone piece of tooling than fits a focused follow-up commit, in
 * the same category as the AST stub-detection gap below.
