/**
 * Vite plugin that writes version.json into the client output directory, recording the version
 * baked into the bundle (config.appVersion, which becomes the Datadog RUM `version`).
 *
 * Datadog only matches uploaded sourcemaps on service + version + filename, so the deploy asserts
 * this file against the release tag before uploading. Writing it from the same resolved value the
 * `process.env.VERSION` define uses is what keeps the two from drifting. See INFRA-3219.
 *
 * Served publicly alongside the other client assets — it holds only the version string the bundle
 * already exposes.
 *
 * @param enabled - Whether the plugin should run
 * @param version - The resolved version baked into the bundle
 * @param projectRoot - The root directory of the project
