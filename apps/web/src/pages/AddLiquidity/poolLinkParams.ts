/**
 * Builds the "+ Create pool" href from the *resolved* currencies the pool browser is showing,
 * carrying them into the create form so it opens pre-seeded instead of blank.
 *
 * Takes `Currency` objects rather than address strings on purpose: an address is meaningless to the
 * create page without the chain it lives on, and taking both off the same object makes it
 * impossible to emit one without the other. Reconstructing the chain from a *filter* param instead
 * is what made an earlier revision of this emit `?currencyA=…` with no `chain` once the network
 * filter was set to "All" — the create page then resolved the pair against its own default chain,
 * seeding mainnet ETH for a token picked on Base.
 *
 * Emits the same `currencyA`/`currencyB`/`chain` params (and the same `NATIVE_CHAIN_ID` sentinel)
 * that the pool-row links already write — no new param scheme. An unresolved token is simply left
 * out, so the worst case is the blank form we had before rather than a wrong-chain address — but
 * only because the caller refuses to resolve a selection whose chain it does not know. Resolving
 * with no chain hint yields the *connected* chain's native currency, not `undefined`, which would
 * arrive here as a perfectly well-formed pair on the wrong chain; see `useResolvedBrowserSelection`.
