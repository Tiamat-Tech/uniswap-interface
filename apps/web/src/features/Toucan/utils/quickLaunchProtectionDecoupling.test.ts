/**
 * Corpus-wide tripwire for the quick-launch / token-protection decoupling.
 *
 * `is_quick_launch` is derived purely from on-chain launch parameters, and the quick-launch preset
 * is reproducible by anyone permissionlessly — so an attacker can mint the flag for a scam token
 * just by matching the preset. Every auction surface may use it for cosmetic and discovery
 * treatment (badge, filter chip, progress cell, FDV-input layout, link-out), and none of them may
 * let it suppress, downgrade, or bypass a Blockaid / token-protection verdict or the flagged-token
 * hiding.
 *
 * ## This file is NOT the guarantee — `AuctionHeader.test.tsx` is
 *
 * The invariant is asserted behaviourally in `../Auction/AuctionHeader.test.tsx`, which renders the
 * real header against a malicious token and checks the warning appears with identical severity
 * whether or not the auction is a quick launch. That test is the anchor. Read it first, and do not
 * weaken it.
 *
 * What this file adds on top is one cheap, deliberately shallow thing the behavioural test cannot
 * do: it sweeps *every* source under `apps/web/src` — including surfaces that do not exist yet —
 * and reds if the flag and a protection signal are wired together in one expression. It is a
 * tripwire over breadth, not a proof over depth.
 *
 * ## Exactly what it catches
 *
 * A protection symbol and a quick-launch symbol, **both written under their own names**, joined by a
 * boolean or conditional operator on **one logical line** — where a logical line is a physical line
 * plus the continuation lines the formatter wrapped off it ({@link toLogicalLines}). That is the
 * shape the original regression took: `!isQuickLaunch && shouldShowAuctionTokenWarning(token)`.
 *
 * ## Exactly what it does NOT catch
 *
 * This list is longer than the one above, and that is the point:
 *
 *  1. control flow: an early `return null` under `if (isQuickLaunch) {`;
 *  2. a one-hop alias: `const suppress = isQuickLaunch`, then `showTokenWarning && !suppress`;
 *  3. the flag handed to a component as a prop: `<TokenWarningCard suppressed={isQuickLaunch} />`;
 *  4. a quick-launch value passed as a function argument;
 *  5. **a gate that wraps the protection UI in a JSX subtree** — `{!isQuickLaunch && (` above a
 *     `<MouseoverTooltip>` / `<>` / `<Flex>` holding `<WarningIcon />`, where the two symbols end up
 *     on genuinely different logical lines;
 *  6. a gate renamed clean out of {@link PROTECTION_GATE_FRAGMENTS}.
 *
 * Shape 5 *was* caught, by a bracket-depth subtree walk that has been removed. Over eight review
 * rounds every fix to that walk opened another hole in the same class — it miscounted brackets over
 * stripped-but-unparsed text, so a stray `)` in JSX prose could either fold into a gate head and
 * scan a live coupling clean, or swallow a gate's closer and red an unrelated author's file that
 * contained no coupling at all. Both failure directions were worse than the blind spot: one is a
 * false green on the exact thing being guarded, the other reds `main` for someone else. Catching
 * shape 5 properly needs a parser, i.e. a type-aware lint rule over the real AST — and shape 5 is
 * covered behaviourally by `AuctionHeader.test.tsx` at the surface that actually renders it.
 *
 * **Read this list before treating a green run as proof.** A green here means "nobody wrote the one
 * shape below on one line", not "quick launch cannot suppress protection".
 *
 * The single-`CurrencyInfo` signature on `auctionTokenProtection.ts` constrains only shape 4, and
 * only for those two helpers — not a component prop and not a local rename.
 *
 * Two things this scanner deliberately does not rely on, each of which made an earlier revision
 * report green over a live regression:
 *  - a hand-written list of helper names — the render gates read *derived booleans*
 *    (`showTokenWarning`, `shouldShowTokenWarning`), so matching is by symbol fragment;
 *  - a hand-maintained file list — it is path-pinned and goes stale silently, so the surfaces are
 *    discovered instead.
 *
 * The stripper's and the line-joiner's exact semantics live in the `the decoupling scanner itself`
 * block at the bottom of this file. **That is the place to add a shape** — whether you are closing
 * a bypass or pinning a false positive. If you find yourself adding bracket arithmetic there to
 * reach across lines, stop: that is the machinery that was removed, and the behavioural test is the
 * right place for the shape you are chasing.

 *
 * Single left-to-right pass, because the order matters. Three revisions of this scanner shipped a
 * runaway `/*` that blanked the rest of the FILE and made the whole suite pass vacuously:
 *  - first, block-comment detection ran *before* strings and `//` comments were removed, so a `/*`
 *    inside `'https://pools.trade/*'` or `// match src/features/*` was honoured as a comment;
 *  - then, quote scanning was bounded to one physical line, so an opening backtick on a **multi-line
 *    template literal** never found its close, the literal's body was scanned as source, and a `/*`
 *    inside it flipped the same switch;
 *  - then, a span whose brackets did not balance was handed back to the scanner to be re-read as
 *    code, so a `/*` inside an unbalanced angle-bracket literal (`'src/<name>(/*.tsx'`) was honoured
 *    after all. A quoted span is now consumed on **every** branch — see the comment at the branch.
 *
 * Hence both `inBlockComment` and `inTemplateLiteral` persist across lines, and `unterminated`
 * reports either one still being open at EOF. Valid TypeScript never ends inside either, so callers
 * scanning real files assert it is `null` — that turns any future runaway into a red instead of a
