 * meantime was capped against `undefined` — a no-op. Nothing downstream corrects it either:
 * the ceiling-dependent effect only re-snaps in fiat mode, and every write path into this
 * field suppresses the next blur snap, so blur early-returns. Left alone the field keeps
 * showing an amount the bid will not use.
 *
 * Fires only on the transition, and only when the current value is actually over the
 * ceiling, so a legal value is never pushed back through the write path for nothing.
