/**
 * The VerifyWallet request params for the current auction, derived in one place.
 *
 * The entire params object is the react-query key, so the KYC status hook and the
 * max-bid-price hook share a cache entry only if their params match by VALUE, not merely by
 * field shape. Deriving the values here — rather than in each consumer — keeps the two
 * subscriptions on one cache entry instead of issuing two VerifyWallet requests per auction
 * page view.
 *
 * Worth knowing: BidForm holds the auction address under two names (`auctionAddress` and
 * `auctionContractAddress`), so hand-assembling these params at a call site is an easy way
 * to drift without noticing.
