 * publish, while the store still holds the previous one. Hand-set mock state is frozen and always
 * self-consistent, so it cannot reproduce that skew — which is exactly why an earlier revision
 * shipped with the undecidable log firing on every healthy load. Leaving `publishedCheckpoint`
 * ahead of the store's `checkpointData` here reproduces it faithfully.
 *
 * @param ended - Whether the auction has ended (drives the progress state the hook reads).
 * @param detailsSettled - Whether the independent GetAuction path has settled.
 * @param publishedCheckpoint - The checkpoint the caller is publishing this render.
