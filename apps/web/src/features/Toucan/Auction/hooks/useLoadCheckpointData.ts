  // store momentarily reading Success-with-no-checkpoint: exactly `checkpointSettledEmpty`, which
  // resolves an ended auction to FAILED. A graduated auction would hold a false failure outcome for
  // that instant, and any subscriber that reads it renders "failed to launch". Publishing the
  // payload first makes the intermediate state fail safe: it is only ever "data present, not yet
  // marked settled", which classifies from the real amounts or holds UNKNOWN and keeps the skeleton.
  //
  // React 18 batches both updates into one effect flush, so nothing renders in between today; this
  // ordering is what keeps that a convenience rather than the only thing standing between a
  // graduated auction and a one-frame false failure claim. Keep these two effects adjacent.
