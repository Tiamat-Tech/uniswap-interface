 * Both stalls share a shape. Checkpoint polling stops once the auction leaves IN_PROGRESS, so an
 * ended auction whose graduation cannot be decided waits on data that will never arrive and holds
 * the skeleton indefinitely. That is invisible without a log, and it is the failure this whole
 * feature exists to avoid mistaking for a failed launch.
 *
 * Split out of `useLoadCheckpointData` so that hook is only fetch-and-publish: ~70 lines of
 * logging sat between its load-state memo and its two publish effects, whose relative order is
 * load-bearing (payload before load state). Keeping the coupled effects adjacent there is what
 * makes that invariant hard to break by accident.

  // A failed checkpoint leaves the auction's outcome permanently undecided, so the page waits on
  // data that will never arrive. Only worth reporting once that wait is terminal: `refetchInterval`
  // is live only while IN_PROGRESS, so a mid-auction failure is retried on the next poll and is
  // ordinary transient noise. Gating on ENDED does not lose that signal, it defers it — `isError`
  // persists, so an auction that ends still unresolved logs on the transition, which is the moment
  // it actually becomes a stall.
  //
  // A failed *poll* is not a failed *load*: react-query keeps the last successful `data`, so an
  // auction whose final refetch errored can still have a perfectly good checkpoint in hand and a
  // decided outcome. `publishedCheckpoint === null` is what makes this "no usable checkpoint"
  // rather than merely "the last request errored" — without it the diagnostic fires on a healthy
  // decided auction and burns the dedupe key. Deliberately not `outcome === UNKNOWN`: that is a
  // derived store value, so it lags this render's payload (the same trap as the sibling effect
  // below), and it also reads UNKNOWN when block data is merely missing — which would let this log
  // fire on an auction that does have its checkpoint.
  //
  // ENDED plus no-checkpoint, unlike the sibling effect below: that one additionally waits on
  // `isAuctionDetailsSettled` because it reads `requiredCurrencyRaised` off the independent
  // GetAuction path. Here the failed request is itself the evidence, so nothing else has to land.
  //
  // createLogOnceGuard claims the key only after `isTerminal` passes, so the ordering this used to
  // depend on — gate before guard — is now structural rather than a comment.
