/**
 * The Q96 max price a bid will actually be submitted at, from the max-valuation input.
 *
 * This is the value the submit path and the chart's bid line read, so it — not the
 * blur-time validation — is where the auction's constraints have to hold. Every
 * non-keyboard write path into the field (chart tick click, slider, opening the review
 * modal) suppresses the next blur snap, so a check that only runs on blur is skippable
 * by construction; clicking a charted tick above the ceiling is a concrete example.
 *
 * Two constraints, in order:
 *  - snapped to the tick grid, which also absorbs precision loss from the
 *    decimal-string → currency-amount → Q96 round trip;
 *  - clamped to the highest tick at or below the hook's ceiling.
 *
 * A clamped submit bids at the highest legal price rather than reverting with
 * MaxBidPriceExceeded, which is the closest legal reading of the stated intent. Clamping is
 * the only guard: an over-ceiling value is capped everywhere it is written rather than
 * reported back as an error, so the field never holds a price the hook would reject.
 *
 * The clamp is NOT unconditional, and the two exceptions are not covered the same way:
 *
 *  - A ceiling below the floor price has no legal tick, and `isMaxBidPriceReached` reports
 *    the auction closed for exactly that case, so the form is disabled.
 *  - With no tick grid yet there is no clamp target and the price is returned unsnapped.
 *    `isMaxBidPriceReached` does NOT cover this one — it needs the grid itself and reports
 *    false without it. This is the auction-details loading window, before the form has the
 *    data to submit anything; it is not a state the ceiling protects.
