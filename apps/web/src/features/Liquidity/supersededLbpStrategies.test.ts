/**
 * Per-chain expectations, both pinned exactly.

 * `current` is the address `getLauncherAddresses` returns under the pinned SDK, and it is the field
 * that catches a forgotten append: it moves on EVERY rotation. A count cannot, because
 * `lbpStrategiesForChain` returns `1 + superseded.length` — a rotation that re-points the SDK with
 * no append here moves one address from "current" to "never read" and leaves the total unchanged, so
 * a count-only assertion stays green while every reservation on the outgoing strategy goes unread.
 * That is the exact failure this table exists to catch, so the count is not enough on its own.
 *
 * `generations` is the current strategy plus every superseded one, as an exact count rather than a
 * lower bound, because a lower bound pins nothing: every deployed chain has had at least one
 * rotation, so `length > 1` held while seven chains were each a full pre-registry generation short.
 * It still earns its place beside `current` — it is what fails when an append is DROPPED from an
 * entry the SDK has long since moved past, which leaves `current` correct.
 *
 * So a bump past a rotation edits both fields for the chain it touches, in the same change that
 * appends the outgoing address to {@link SUPERSEDED_LBP_STRATEGIES}.
 *
 * Addresses are the pinned SDK's. Counts come from the public LBPStrategy deployment table and the
 * CCA indexer's per-chain strategy history, confirmed on chain.
