 * tick into positions parked further out — so that pool's history is real, and a borrowed one would
 * only be a proxy for it. Only a pool holding nothing has no series to show, and it is the one that
 * borrows, falling back to its own id when the pair has no sibling (all a pool that was emptied has
 * left).
 *
 * `hasOwnPositions` comes from the raw ticks, not the density chart's distribution: the distribution
 * is undefined whenever `computeSurroundingTicks` can't find a pivot, which is every pool whose
 * positions all sit on one side of the active tick — exactly the shape this branch exists for.
 *
 * The choice is withheld while it could still change, so a provisional id can't fire a query the real
 * one then discards. Once the pool's own ticks have arrived there is nothing left to wait for — the
 * answer is pinned, whatever the sibling lookup goes on to say. A pool being created skips the tick
 * fetch entirely, so its state must not gate this either.

 * line to draw. Neither means anything until the price line is known, which takes both of
 * `getPriceLineSource`'s `priceSourceLoading` (which pool's series to ask for) and
 * `priceQueryLoading` (that series arriving) — an unasked or in-flight series has no entries, and
 * reading that as "no line" would flash the inputs-only view on the way in. They are taken
