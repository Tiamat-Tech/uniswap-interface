/**
 * Web portal primitive: a TRUE document-level portal.
 *
 * `createPortal(..., document.body)` relocates the subtree in the DOM, not
 * just in the React tree, so the overlay is a child of `<body>` and is
 * subject to no ancestor's stacking context, clip, `overflow`, `transform`,
 * `filter` or `contain`. That property is the whole reason this primitive
 * exists: the call sites moving onto it are overlays that must escape a
 * transformed ancestor (`RecentlyConnectedModal` says so in a comment at its
 * portal), and a portal HOST rendered inside the React tree (Tamagui's own
 * `PortalHost`, a `<div style="display:contents">`, or the native
 * `AppPortalHost`) cannot do that.
 *
 * The mechanism, the wrapper element and the z-index arithmetic are all
 * ported from `@tamagui/portal`'s web `Portal`, which was already doing
 * exactly this, so z-order is preserved by construction rather than by
 * coincidence. Three details carry that parity and must not drift:
 *
 * - `position: fixed; inset: 0` makes the wrapper a full-window layer, so
 *   children position against the viewport rather than the portal's DOM
 *   parent.
 * - `contain: strict` isolates the wrapper's layout/paint, matching what the
 *   overlays were already rendering inside.
 * - `pointer-events: none` keeps the full-window layer from swallowing clicks
 *   meant for the page; overlay content re-enables its own.

/**

 * The trade this makes, deliberately, for Tamagui parity: it is module-level
 * mutable state, so every provider-less portal in the process stacks against
 * every other one, process-globally rather than per mount. Tamagui's registry
 * was module-level in exactly the same way. Mount a `PortalProvider` to get an
 * isolated scope, which is what `apps/web` does at its root and what the tests
