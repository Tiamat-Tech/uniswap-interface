/**
 * Native portal primitive, on `@rn-primitives/portal` — the same host-based
 * teleport `ui/src/components/portal/Portal.native.tsx` already ships
 * (`PrimitivePortal` into a named `PortalHost`). Delegating rather than
 * hand-rolling a second host keeps one native portal mechanism in the repo, so
 * repointing that leg here is an import swap with no on-device behavior change
 * to re-evidence.
 *
 * What this leg adds over the primitive is the two things `ui/src` gets from
 * elsewhere: the resolved z-index (shared with the web leg through `stack.ts`)
 * and a per-provider scope. `@rn-primitives/portal`'s registry is module-global
 * keyed by host name, so `PortalProvider` mints its own host name from `useId`
 * and hands it down with the stack registry; two providers therefore cannot see
 * each other's portals, matching the web leg's per-provider stacking scope.
 *
 * Wrapper parity with the `ui/src` portal: each entry is wrapped in an
 * absolutely-filled `box-none` `View` carrying the resolved z-index, so
 * full-screen overlay placement and touch pass-through are unchanged.
 *
 * KNOWN DIVERGENCE FROM THE WEB LEG, pinned by a test rather than only
 * described here. Children are re-parented into the host's subtree, so they are
 * rendered under the PROVIDER's context, not the call site's. React context
 * provided between `PortalProvider` and a `Portal` is therefore invisible to
 * that portal's children on native, while on web it flows normally because
 * `createPortal` relocates the subtree in the DOM only. There is no clean fix
 * inside this primitive: React Native has no DOM to relocate into, so a
 * host-based portal necessarily renders at the host. Anything a native portal's
 * children need must be passed as props or provided above the
 * `PortalProvider`. It is the constraint the `ui/src` leg already lives with,
 * so repointing it here would not introduce it.
 *
 * NOTE: no call site imports this leg yet. Native was already Tamagui-free
 * through `ui/src/components/portal/Portal.native.tsx`, so repointing it here
 * is a consolidation that needs on-device evidence, not part of removing
 * Tamagui. This leg exists so the primitive's two legs match and the entry
 * point is honest on both platforms.
