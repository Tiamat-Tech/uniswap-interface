/**
 * `@universe/mycelium/animatable-copy-icon-compat` — the compat
 * `AnimatableCopyIcon` (INFRA-3653), replacing the legacy Tamagui
 * `AnimatableCopyIcon` from
 * `packages/ui/src/components/AnimatableCopyIcon/AnimatableCopyIcon.tsx`.
 *
 * The component is imported by its BASE specifier so Metro resolves the
 * `.native.tsx` leg and vite the `.web.tsx` leg; the platform-neutral modules
 * (`./props`, `./resolve`) are shared by both legs, which is what keeps their
 * exports and behavior identical.
