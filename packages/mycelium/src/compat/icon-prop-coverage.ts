/**
 * The documented-rejected half of the mycelium icon style-prop boundary
 * (INFRA-3320).
 *
 * `SUPPORTED_ICON_STYLE_PROPS` (icon-props.ts) is the supported half: the
 * legacy `ui/src` icon style props mycelium icons accept first-class, so a
 * conversion is a pure import swap. Every other style prop the repo-wide icon
 * call-site census found is listed HERE with the reason it stays out, and
 * `icon-prop-coverage.test.ts` pins supported ∪ rejected = the census's
 * 42-prop universe exactly — so the boundary only ever moves by an explicit
 * decision, and a converter can read it before starting a batch instead of
 * discovering it one manual-lane flag at a time.
 *
 * The split is a data decision, not a taste one: census of all 1,396 ui/src
 * icon call sites across 744 files (2026-08-05), published with per-prop
 * occurrence counts on INFRA-3320. Everything the compat style machinery can
 * already express is supported (the ruling: icon styling stays the same
 * through the migration); the seven rejections below are animation-driver
 * props and single-call-site wrapper-shaped usages. `position`/`left` moved
 * to the supported half (INFRA-3320 widening) once a real call site
 * (packages/wallet ChooseNftModal.tsx's absolutely-positioned close icon)
 * needed them — the "wrapper-shaped, fix at the call site" reasoning that
 * held them out was a cold-prop deferral, not a substantive rejection.
