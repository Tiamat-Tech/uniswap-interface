 * The documented-rejected half of the compat colour boundary.
 *
 * `COLOR_TOKEN_CLASS` + `THEMED_COLOR_TOKEN_CLASSES` (tokens.ts) are the
 * supported half: the `ui/src` theme colour tokens the compat compilers map to
 * real `@universe/tailwind` utilities. Every other token the legacy theme
 * resolves is listed HERE with the reason it stays a hard compile error. For
 * the life of the migration, supported ∪ rejected was pinned to equal the
 * `ui/src` theme's token set exactly, so every legacy token landed in one of
 * the two lists by an explicit decision; the lists remain the documented
 * boundary a reader consults before touching compat colour handling.
 *
 * The split is a data decision, not a taste one: a census of the then-71
 * rejected tokens across the 2,080-file Tamagui frontier (frontier = the
 * INFRA-2351 import census, `packages/ui` excluded; 2026-08-04, main
 * @ bd526562) found 23 in use with 169 total occurrences. The 17 widened
 * tokens cover 121 of those occurrences; `$shadowColor`/`$shadowColorHover`
 * (28 more, the hottest deferred family) were widened once the native-CSS
 * entry settled; every remaining occurrence is accounted for by a reason
 * below.
