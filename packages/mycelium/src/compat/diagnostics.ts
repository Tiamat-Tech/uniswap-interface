/**
 * The compat compilers' diagnostics lane: the bounded report stream
 * (`logBoundedOnce`), the unknown-pool-key reporter (INFRA-3260) and the icon
 * lanes' shared `$`-colour resolution (`iconColorOrLog` — one acceptance set
 * and one reporter for both legs) and the layout lane's
 * `backgroundColor`/`borderColor` token reporter (`unmappedColorTokenClasses`). The dev-gate itself lives in `dev-build.ts`
 * (shared with `compose.ts`/`web-diagnostics.ts`) — imported here rather than
 * re-declared, so there is exactly one `isDevelopmentBuild()`.
 *
 * Everything on this lane reports through `@universe/logger` at ERROR level
 * rather than calling `console.warn` directly. Two reasons, both from review on
 * this file: the package is the house logging surface (mycelium already depends
 * on it and uses it in `UniversalList`, `AnchorCompat` and `TouchableTextLink`),
 * and warnings are lost in this app's console noise, while both diagnostics
 * carried here are real defects — a colour token that maps to no CSS, or a
 * compat key that compiles to nothing.
 *
 * The level is a REPORTING choice and nothing more. `logger.error` formats its
 * message, calls `console.error` and returns; it does not throw, rethrow or
 * abort the caller (`packages/logger/src/consoleLogger.ts`). That is load-
 * bearing here: this lane exists so an unresolvable colour costs one colour
 * instead of the whole render, and an escalating report would undo it.
