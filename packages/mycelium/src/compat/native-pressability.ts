/**
 * Responder-level press wiring for the compat layout legs (INFRA-3536):
 * responder-inert without handlers, a11y-silent, and hit-test-identical to
 * the plain RN `View` the legs always mount. This module OWNS the rationale —
 * the legs carry pointers, not copies.
 *
 * Why not RN `Pressable` (measured on Pressability.js / Pressable.js): its
 * claim, `onStartShouldSetResponder: () => !disabled ?? true`, is
 * unconditional and bubble-phase, so even a handler-less Pressable claims
 * touches on descendants — nested inside a TouchableArea it swallows the
 * ancestor's press; its only off switch, `disabled`, folds into
 * `accessibilityState` AFTER the caller's own prop, so inertness would read
 * as "disabled" to screen readers; and `pointerEvents="box-none"` neither
 * stops the bubble-phase claim nor preserves plain-View overlay blocking.
 * Hence: the plain View host (one element type for the component's life — a
 * conditionally-passed handler never remounts the subtree) plus these
 * responder props, attached only while a handler is live.
 *
 * No implicit a11y props either way: legacy Tamagui's native press path sets
 * neither `accessible` nor `focusable` (measured on @tamagui/web's
 * createComponent.native.js + getSplitStyles.native.js), and an implicit
 * `accessible: true` would flatten the subtree into ONE screen-reader
 * element, hiding focusable descendants. `nativeCompatProps`' allow-list is
 * the single owner of `accessible`; call sites opt in as pre-conversion.
 *
 * Dispatch matches Pressability's defaults: grant → onPressIn, long press at
 * 500ms firing onLongPress and cancelling onPress, release → onPressOut then
 * onPress, terminate (responder stolen) → onPressOut only, termination
 * allowed. Press-rect move-cancel too: the grant target is measured
 * (Pressability's grant-time measure) and sliding off the offset-expanded
 * rect fires onPressOut and makes the eventual release a no-op; sliding back
 * in re-fires onPressIn. The long-press timer runs regardless and is gated
 * at fire time on being inside the rect (Pressability's press-in state
 * gate). An unmeasurable grant target (DOM/test hosts) leaves move-cancel
 * inert. A mid-gesture handler detach finishes the gesture eagerly: the
 * pending onPressOut fires with the last live handler set and the timer
 * dies. This hook is also TouchableAreaCompat's dispatch path (its RNGH-host
 * gesture props lose arbitration to outer RNGH gestures; the responder
 * pipeline does not) — TextCompat alone keeps RN Text's built-in
 * pressability. RN's own Pressability stays deliberately unused: it is a
 * private deep import (react-native/Libraries/…) with no types or exports
 * entry, so this module implements the same contract on public API only.
 * Accepted divergence: no delayPressIn/delayPressOut/minPressDuration knobs.
