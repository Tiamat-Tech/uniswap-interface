/**
 * Platform-leg contract for the IconButton compat, following
 * `spinning-loader-compat/platform-legs.test.ts`.
 *
 * Why this has to exist: `moduleSuffixes` is configured nowhere in the repo, so
 * `tsc` only ever resolves the BASE leg — a `.native` leg cannot carry a
 * different type, and nothing in the typechecker notices if it exports a
 * different symbol set. A bundler that resolved the native leg would then hit a
 * missing export at runtime. The base leg is a 1-line re-export of the web leg,
 * so base ≡ web is a structural given; base ≡ native is what this suite proves.
 */

// The native leg's dependency closure resolves untranspiled RN-flavored
// sources under this jsdom config — serve the button-compat stand-ins instead
// (the spinning-loader-compat precedent). The real modules are exercised by
// the packages/tailwind native parity harness.
