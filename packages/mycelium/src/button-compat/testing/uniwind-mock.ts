/**
 * Minimal uniwind stand-in for the button-compat vitest suites.
 *
 * The native leg resolves its children's concrete colour through uniwind's
 * public `useResolveClassNames`. Under mycelium's jsdom config the `uniwind`
 * specifier lands on the package's TypeScript SOURCE (its `react-native` export
 * condition), which Node cannot parse — `SyntaxError: Unexpected token
 * 'typeof'`. Merely IMPORTING the native leg trips it, so it is mocked here
 * alongside react-native / gesture-handler / reanimated for the same reason.
 *
 * This is a stand-in for a NATIVE-ONLY dependency in a jsdom suite, not a
 * substitute for proving the resolution: the real hook, hydrated by uniwind's
 * own bundler pipeline, is what the native parity harness exercises
 * (`packages/tailwind/src/parity/button/native-parity.test.tsx`).
