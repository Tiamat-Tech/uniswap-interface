/**
 * ButtonCompat COMPILED-CSS GATE (INFRA-3230).
 *
 * Every other test in this family asserts on class *names* — the rendered
 * string (`web-class-pin.test.tsx`), the compiler's output, the native
 * expectations. None of them touches the compiled stylesheet, so none of them
 * can see the one failure mode that class-name assertions are structurally
 * blind to: a class that is emitted into the DOM but that Tailwind never
 * generated a rule for. It renders, it looks right in a snapshot, and it paints
 * nothing.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical here. Tailwind v4 builds CSS from Oxide's *text*
 * scan of the registered `@source` roots. Decomposing the [variant][emphasis]
 * cells into `ScopedCell` scopes moved every `hover:` / `active:` /
 * `focus-visible:` / `group-hover/sbtn:` prefixed class out of source text and
 * into a runtime concatenation in `joinScopes`, which a text scanner cannot see.
 * `FRAME_JOINED_CELLS` / `TEXT_JOINED_CELLS` in `./variantEmphasisHash` are the
 * literals that put them back. This file is what makes that load-bearing
 * instead of decorative.
 *
 * NOTE FOR EDITORS: do not write a full prefixed class name anywhere in this
 * file, not even in a comment. The scan below covers this file too, so a token
 * spelled here would make its own assertion pass. Every expectation is derived
 * by calling the compilers; keep it that way.
 *
 * Three assertions, in the order a regression would hit them:
 *
 *  1. SET EQUALITY — the literal tables cover exactly the compound tokens
 *     `joinScopes` produces from the `ScopedCell` data. Neither table is the
 *     source of truth for the other; a divergence in either direction fails.
 *  2. COMPILED-CSS COVERAGE — compile the REAL consumer entry
 *     (`apps/web/src/tailwind.css`) with the real Tailwind Node API, over a real
 *     Oxide scan of mycelium's sources, then assert every interaction class the
 *     web leg can emit, over the full prop matrix, resolves to an actual rule
 *     with actual declarations. The entry's own `@import` graph is the only thing
 *     that can supply those rules — there is no hand-written mirror of the entry
 *     anywhere in this file, which is the point: a mirror stays green while the
 *     real entry stops importing mycelium.
 *  3. CONSUMER COVERAGE — assertion 2 proves the entry's imports generate those
 *     rules for a scan of `packages/mycelium/src`; on its own it cannot prove the
 *     app performs such a scan, so narrowing the consumer's `@source` root would
 *     strip all 56 classes with this file still green. So: compose the same
 *     entry's scan roots exactly as `@tailwindcss/vite` does, keep the positive
 *     ones that reach mycelium's sources, carry every `@source not` through to
 *     Oxide unchanged, and re-scan for the same tokens. Roots are matched as
 *     resolved absolute globs, segment by segment with glob segments treated as
 *     globs, never string-compared — so an equivalently spelled or genuinely
 *     broader root (a wildcard package segment, the whole repo) passes and only a
 *     narrowed, dropped, or newly excluded one fails.
 *
 * Both compiled assertions run off ONE compile of that entry, kept rather than
 * discarded, so nothing in this gate describes the consumer second-hand.
 *
 * The scan in assertion 2 is scoped to `packages/mycelium/src` — exactly the
 * `@source` root a consuming app registers for mycelium. Deliberately NOT the
 * consumer's own tree: mycelium has to be self-sufficient, and widening the scan
 * would let unrelated coincidences elsewhere in the monorepo stand in for
 * coverage this package owes (measured: `labs/sandbox` happens to spell 5 of
 * these 42 tokens, in an app with a separate Tailwind build that does nothing
 * for apps/web).
 *
 * Assertion 3 pins apps/web only. It is the app the web leg ships into, and it
 * is the only mycelium consumer whose coverage is a bare `@source` line — the
 * positional, silently-breakable mechanism the assertion exists to hold. The
 * other consumers (apps/dev-portal, apps/mission-control, labs/workbench,
 * labs/rh-cca) get theirs from `content` globs in a `@config` JS config instead,
 * which is a different mechanism to pin (and one `compile()` cannot evaluate
 * without a module loader); pinning those belongs with whoever owns those
 * entries. Reading a consumer file by path keeps this a one-way dependency:
 * mycelium must never take a build edge on an app.
 *
 * The expected token set is DERIVED — computed by running the web compilers over
 * the matrix — so this file contains no class literals of its own and cannot
 * scanner-feed its own assertions.
