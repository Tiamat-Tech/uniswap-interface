/**
 * `@universe/mycelium/refresh-button-compat` — the compat `RefreshButton`
 * (INFRA-3489), replacing the legacy `ui/src` `RefreshButton` composite from
 * `packages/ui/src/components/RefreshButton/`.
 *
 * The component is imported by its BASE specifier so Metro resolves the
 * `.native.tsx` leg (a deliberate throwing stub — the render is web-guarded
 * at the sole consumer) and vite the `.web.tsx` leg; the platform-neutral
 * modules (`./props`, `./compile`) are shared, which is what keeps the legs'
 * exports identical (pinned by `platform-legs.test.ts`).
