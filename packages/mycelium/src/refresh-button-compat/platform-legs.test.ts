/**
 * Platform-leg contract for the RefreshButton compat (INFRA-3489), following
 * `modal-close-icon/platform-legs.test.ts` / `checkbox-compat`.
 *
 * Why this has to exist: `moduleSuffixes` is configured nowhere in the repo,
 * so `tsc` only ever resolves the BASE leg — a `.native` leg cannot carry a
 * different type, and nothing in the typechecker notices if it exports a
 * different symbol set. A bundler that resolved the native leg would then hit
 * a missing export at runtime. Unlike the modal-close-icon (real native leg),
 * this compat's base and native legs are BOTH deliberate throwing stubs — the
 * base because a platform override must always resolve, the native because
 * the native leg is deferred (the sole consumer web-guards the render) — so
 * this suite additionally pins that both stubs throw loudly instead of
 * rendering nothing.
