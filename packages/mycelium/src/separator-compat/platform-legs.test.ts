/**
 * Platform-leg contract for the Separator compat (INFRA-3644), following
 * `checkbox-compat/platform-legs.test.ts`.
 *
 * Why this has to exist: `moduleSuffixes` is configured nowhere in the repo, so
 * `tsc` only ever resolves the BASE leg — a `.native` leg cannot carry a
 * different type, and nothing in the typechecker notices if it exports a
 * different symbol set. A bundler that resolved the native leg would then hit a
 * missing export at runtime. The base leg is a 1-line re-export of the web leg,
 * so base ≡ web is a structural given; base ≡ native is what this suite proves.
 */
