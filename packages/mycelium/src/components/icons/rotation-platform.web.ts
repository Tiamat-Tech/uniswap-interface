 * Web leg of the rotation-wrapper icons' two platform-resolved pieces: how RTL
 * is read, and whether the rotate animates through CSS.
 *
 * A per-icon `RotatableChevron.native.tsx` twin would never be resolved — the
 * `./icons/*` subpath maps deep icon imports to exact `.tsx` files and bundlers
 * take an exports target literally. So the split rides `rotation-platform`'s
 * EXTENSIONLESS internal import instead, the same mechanism the generated
 * icons' `factories/svg-elements` host shim uses: web resolvers load this leg
 * (directly, or through the base leg's re-export), Metro and the native parity
 * harness load `rotation-platform.native.ts`. Keeping `react-native` out of
 * this leg is what lets it stay an optional peer.
 *
 * Export set pinned against the native leg by `__tests__/platform-legs.test.tsx`.
