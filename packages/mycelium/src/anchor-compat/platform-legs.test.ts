/**
 * Platform-leg contract for the Anchor compat (INFRA-3549), following
 * `modal-close-icon/platform-legs.test.ts`.
 *
 * Why this has to exist: `moduleSuffixes` is configured nowhere in the repo, so
 * `tsc` only ever resolves the BASE leg — a `.native` leg cannot carry a
 * different type, and nothing in the typechecker notices if it exports a
 * different symbol set. A bundler that resolved the native leg would then hit a
 * missing export at runtime. The base leg is a 1-line re-export of the web leg
 * (the `TouchableAreaCompat.tsx` mechanism), so base ≡ web is a structural
 * given; base ≡ native is what this suite proves.
