/**
 * Reanimated adapter for the Spore animation preset curves (INFRA-2967).
 *
 * Materializes the platform-agnostic curve data from `./curves` into real
 * `react-native-reanimated` configs/animations. Native-only: import via the
 * `@universe/tailwind/animations/reanimated` subpath from React Native code
 * (hand-written Reanimated call sites, the native mycelium compat layer) —
 * never from web bundles, which should import `@universe/tailwind/animations`
 * for the pure data instead.
 *
 * Exact-port contract: every function forwards precisely the keys the legacy
 * Tamagui moti driver forwards for the same preset — declared keys verbatim,
 * no defaults filled in, `delay` applied via `withDelay` outside the config —
 * so a converted call site animates byte-identically to its legacy
 * `animation="<name>"` counterpart. `curves.reanimated.test.ts` pins this
 * against the installed moti/reanimated sources.
