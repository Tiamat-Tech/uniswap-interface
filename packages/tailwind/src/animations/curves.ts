 * Spore animation preset curves — the shared curve library (INFRA-2967).

 * The timing/spring numbers are ported byte-exact from the legacy Tamagui
 * animation driver config (`packages/ui/src/theme/animations/index.native.ts`
 * plus the generated `delay200ms.ts` family), and the CSS strings from its web
 * driver (`index.web.ts`). This module is pure data — platform-agnostic and
 * safe to import from web bundles. Native consumers materialize the curves
 * into Reanimated configs via `./reanimated` (subpath
 * `@universe/tailwind/animations/reanimated`); the mycelium compat props
 * reference the curve names for their `animation` prop surface.
 *
 * Exactness against the legacy source files is pinned by
 * `curves.parity.test.ts` — edit the legacy config and that test fails until
 * this file is re-synced (and vice versa).
