 * separate node holding the decimal separator and decimals so they can be faded — so a plain
 * `getByText('$45.66')` finds nothing even though the value is rendered and is read contiguously
 * by assistive tech. Matching on `textContent` keeps the assertion exact (it still proves the
 * full, correctly formatted value is present) while tolerating that split.
 *
 * Elements that have a child matching the same text are skipped, so the match lands on the node
 * that actually owns the text rather than on every ancestor that contains it.
 *
 * Use this for negative assertions too (`queryByText(withText(...))`). A bare `queryByText` would
 * pass against a split value for the wrong reason — reporting "absent" when the value is present
 * but merely split across nodes.
